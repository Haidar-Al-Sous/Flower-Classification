# Flower Classification using Histogram and Filtering Techniques

## Description
This project applies computer vision techniques, particularly Histogram and Filtering, to classify different types of flowers based on specific features such as color, shape, and edges. The main focus is on distinguishing flowers of the **Asteraceae family** using feature extraction methods like histogram analysis and perspective transformation.

## Features
- Color analysis using histogram.
- Edge detection for flower shape recognition.
- Filtering techniques to enhance image quality.
- Extraction of unique flower features from the Asteraceae family.
  
## Examples
Here are some examples of flower classification:
